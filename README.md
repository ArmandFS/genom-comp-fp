# genom-comp-fp
This is a final project done on one of my courses which is genomic computation. I currently have made a program that calculates the orf of an eukaryotik cell (fasta file) which outputs the genomic data, genomic sequences and statistics of the cells. 

Latest progress includes producing an open reading frame, and also a HMM with ipywidget for the GUI. This HMM goes through all of the DNA sequences
