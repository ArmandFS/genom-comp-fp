# genom-comp-fp
This is a final project done on one of my courses which is genomic computation. I currently have made a program that calculates the orf of an eukaryotik cell (fasta file) which outputs the genomic data, genomic sequences and statistics of the cell. 


the next progress will include maybe trying streamlit as the ui, and creating an actualy HMM.
(HMM is a hidden markov model)
